🍃 Tea Leaf Disease Prediction System

This is an AI-powered Tea Leaf Disease Prediction System built using Deep Learning and Computer Vision. The system helps identify common diseases in tea leaves through image classification, supporting early detection and better crop management in the agricultural industry.

Users can upload an image of a tea leaf, and the model predicts the most likely disease along with a second possible result and confidence levels. The project includes a Streamlit web interface for easy interaction.
